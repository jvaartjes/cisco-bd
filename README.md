# Cisco Business Dashboard Async API Library
Cisco Business Dashboard API PyPi

This library is a requirement for the cisco_business_dashboard Home Assistant Plugin which can be found here:
https://github.com/jvaartjes/cisco_business_dashboard -> TODO: publish to HACS

Currently Supports:
- Authentication using JWT Token
- Getting the Default organisation in JSON format

TODO:
- Parse Groups
- Parse Devices
- Enable / Disable switchports
- Toggle PoE
- Backup Config
- Reboot Devices
- Handle Events

Early Beta stage but works, all feedback is appreciated. This is my first pip package and also my first Home Assistant Integration.
